# Employee Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes an unlabeled dataset of employee messages to evaluate sentiment and engagement. The analysis includes the following tasks:

1. **Sentiment Labeling:**  
   Each employee message is automatically classified as *Positive*, *Negative*, or *Neutral* using NLTK’s VADER, with corresponding numerical scores assigned (+1, -1, 0).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Visualizations are generated to understand data structure, sentiment distribution, monthly message frequency, and monthly average sentiment scores.

3. **Employee Score Calculation:**  
   Monthly sentiment scores for each employee are computed by aggregating the scores of all their messages within each month.

4. **Employee Ranking:**  
   For each month, two lists are generated:  
   - **Top Three Positive Employees:** The three employees with the highest positive aggregated scores.  
   - **Top Three Negative Employees:** The three employees with the lowest (most negative) aggregated scores.  
   Rankings are sorted first by score and then alphabetically by employee identifier.

5. **Flight Risk Identification:**  
   Employees are flagged as potential flight risks if they have sent four or more negative messages within any rolling 30-day period.

6. **Predictive Modeling:**  
   A linear regression model is built (using scikit-learn) to forecast monthly sentiment trends. Model performance is evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE).

## Key Insights

### Representative Monthly Rankings (Example: July 2011)
- **Top Three Positive Employees:**  
  1. **patti.thompson@enron.com** – Score: 16  
  2. **sally.beck@enron.com** – Score: 9  
  3. **bobette.riner@ipgdirect.com** – Score: 8  

- **Top Three Negative Employees:**  
  1. **lydia.delgado@enron.com** – Score: -1  
  2. **kayne.coulter@enron.com** – Score: 1  
  3. **don.baughman@enron.com** – Score: 3  

### Flight Risk Employees (Overall)
- **bobette.riner@ipgdirect.com**  
- **don.baughman@enron.com**  
- **johnny.palmer@enron.com**  
- **sally.beck@enron.com**

### Predictive Model Performance
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 11.90  
*The MSE value indicates the accuracy of the predictive model; lower values represent better predictive performance.*

## Visualizations

All charts and visualizations generated by the analysis are saved in the `visualization` folder. These include:
- `sentiment_distribution.png`: Bar chart showing the count of each sentiment category.
- `monthly_message_frequency.png`: Line chart displaying the number of messages per month.
- `monthly_average_sentiment.png`: Bar chart showing the average sentiment score per month.
- Additional outputs (if available) such as rankings and flight risk reports.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd employee-sentiment-analysis
