    "- **Employee Score Calculation:** Computing monthly sentiment scores for each employee.\n",
    "- **Employee Ranking:** Creating monthly ranking lists:\n",
    "  - Top Three Positive Employees (highest positive scores).\n",
    "  - Top Three Negative Employees (lowest scores).\n",
    "- **Flight Risk Identification:** Flagging employees as potential flight risks if they send four or more negative messages in any rolling 30-day period.\n",
    "- **Predictive Modeling:** Building a linear regression model (using scikit-learn) to forecast monthly sentiment trends, evaluated via mean squared error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements all tasks and generates the required visualizations and outputs.\n"
